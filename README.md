 Thomas Jefferson Garden App
===============================
From 1766 through 1825 Thomas Jefferson kept a horticultural diary.  In his early twenties he recorded that 2500 pea seeds would fit in a pint mason jar.  In November of 1825 he requested from the governor of Ohio seeds for a giant cucumber.  Jefferson had a life long interest in horticulture which made me think if he were alive today what would his journal look like?  I hope to answer that question with the “Thomas Jefferson's Garden App”.

The first version of the application will consist of a RESTful API written in C# with a React.JS front end and a SQLite data store.
